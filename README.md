Hi, I'm Lance Finke and I am currently a student at Lone Star College Cy-Fair. My major is Computer science and I am currently a freshaman. I know Java, pyhton. I have recently began learning and creating projects in frontend development.
My plan is to eventually transfer to a 4 year University and graduate with a bachelor's in Computer Science.
To improve my skillset, I plan to attend several hackathons during my time in College.
